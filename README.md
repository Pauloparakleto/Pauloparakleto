### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paulo Felipe Souza. I'm brazilian, from BelÃ©m state of ParÃ¡, North of Brazil (The north remember).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal web application writen in Ruby on Rails called [Nintendo Mania](https://pauloparakleto.github.io/download_games/), it is to download games. As you may see, I like retro games.
- ðŸ”­ I built a [webhook application in Rails](https://pauloparakleto.github.io/webhookrails/) to listen to issues events on github. It is usefull for developers who want to stay up to date with their favorites projects.

I am a master degree in economic area who is looking for opportunities on changing of carrier to
become a Ruby on Rails developer.

I worked on a startup as a project manager in Brazil. On that, I used to link the developerâ€™s team to the final customer. As the company was in a Business to
Government field (B to G), I needed to visit all local government offices in order to know about problems with absent of efficiency on the fiscal area. This routine gave me the skill to think about a problem and draft all the initial issues to be committed by the web developerâ€™s team.
This continuous contact with the web developers that instigated me to teach me Ruby by myself.
